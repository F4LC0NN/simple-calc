# simple-calc
This project is a simple interactive calculator.

The goal is to use Javascript logic to interact with the calculator.
Here are the subgoals:

- Handle calculations based on the input
- Handle negative numbers for both operands
- Limit the calculation sequence by pair
- Handle big numbers appropriately
- Limit the length of entries and results
- Make sure the calculator clear all stored values when returning results
- Make a button to erase part of the equation one after the one
- Create button animation
- Create a design for the calculator
- Use a constructor to handle the data passed into the calculator
